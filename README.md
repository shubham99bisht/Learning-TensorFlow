# Learning-TensorFlow
My experiments on Tensorflow while I was learning. A good source for any new beginner.<br>
This Repository contains good that I've written while learning from online resources. Course Links have been mentioned below.

## About this Repository

Developing sophisticated machine learning solutions is a difficult task. There are many processing steps that must be performed, and how this processing is performed is a function of not only the code you write, but also the data you use.
In this course, TensorFlow: Getting Started, you'll see how TensorFlow easily addresses these concerns by learning TensorFlow from the bottom up. First, you'll be introduced to the installation process, building simple and advanced models, and utilizing additional libraries that make development even easier. Along the way, you'll learn how the unique architecture in TensorFlow lets you perform your computing on systems as small as a Raspberry Pi, and as large as a data farm. Finally, you'll explore using TensorFlow with neural networks in general, and specifically with powerful deep neural networks. By the end of this course, you'll have a solid foundation on using TensorFlow, and have the knowledge to apply TensorFlow to create your own machine learning solutions.

## About this Repository

My experiments on Tensorflow while I was learning. A good source for any new beginner.<br>
This Repository contains small codes that I've written while learning from online resources. Course Links have been mentioned below.

First, you'll be introduced to the installation process, building simple and advanced models, and utilizing additional libraries that make development even easier.

Along the way, you'll learn how the unique architecture in TensorFlow lets you develop amazing large networks (models) with ease and helps in debugging and monitoring through TensorBoard.

Finally, you'll explore using TensorFlow with neural networks in general, and specifically with powerful deep neural networks. By the time you go through all the code snippets, you'll have a solid foundation on using TensorFlow, and have the knowledge to apply TensorFlow to create your own machine learning solutions.
